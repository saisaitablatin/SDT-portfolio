            love for K-Pop, particularly EXO, their music inspires my creativity and design approach. With a dream to
            travel the world, I seek to infuse global perspectives into my work, making each design unique and

            <h3>Cultura: A Global Events Discovery App</h3>
            <p>This project involves designing 'Cultura', a mobile app that connects users with cultural events
                worldwide. The challenge is to create an intuitive and engaging user interface that allows users to
                easily discover, save, and share events like music festivals, art exhibitions, and traditional
                ceremonies. The UX aspect will focus on a seamless user journey from discovering events to attending
                them, while the UI will emphasize an aesthetic that captures the global diversity of cultures. This
                project will demonstrate skills in user research, responsive design, and creating a cohesive visual
                language that resonates with a diverse user base.</p>
